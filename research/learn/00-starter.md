# Learning About PDFs

This document serves as the starting point for my research and understanding of PDF files.

PDFs are essentially text-based files that define static content, allowing you to build a PDF file
page by page using this static code.

For a deeper and more complex understanding, PostScript plays a role, but due to its complexity and
low-level nature, many prefer to use libraries in JavaScript, C++, C, and Python to create PDFs
dynamically. Popular tools include LaTeX, Markdown, reStructuredText, Python's ReportLab library,
and HTML-to-PDF converters.

## PDF Security and Exploits

The tool I am currently developing, called __Disarm__, is designed to neutralize PDF exploits that
could compromise host computers.

While we will discuss __Disarm__ in detail later, it is important to first build a solid
understanding of PDFs and their creation, as this knowledge is essential for identifying and
preventing exploits.

As part of my research best practices, I maintain a [sources](../sources.md) file documenting all
references and materials I consult. Additionally, I have created a [docs](../docs/) section
containing notes and handy resources to enhance my understanding and to test my knowledge about PDF
learning and exploitation, which will aid in implementing effective exploit prevention.

Also There's folder called [PDFs](../learn/PDFs) that is final projects of each section I've done
myself you can check them out there are some sweet content there too.
