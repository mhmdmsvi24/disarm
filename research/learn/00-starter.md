# Learning About PDFs

In the current state of my understanding about PDFs, they are litrally text files that define the
the static content only and then based on those you can build your PDF file page by page using the
static code for each page.

For deeper and more complex understanding about PDFs we have PostScript but duo to the complexity
and extreme low level others rather to user libraries in JS, CPP, C, Python to create their PDFs
dynamically or other tools such as LaTeX, MarkDown or reStructuredText or Python's ReportLab library
is popular for creating PDFs programmatically or even HTML-to-PDF converters.

## PDF and their exploits

As you've expected the tool I'm currently working on is a called __Disarm__ that disarm PDFs from
any exploits used to penetrate into host computer.

Let's skip about __Disarm__ for now and talk a bit more about PDF security, in this series of
research I'm doing for this project it's neccessary to learn about PDFs itself and how to create
them to actually be able to exploit them so a smooth knowledge is required to develope this project
further.

Also as a research best practice I'll include any sources that I touch in the [sources](../soruces.md)
file plus I decided to add another section [docs](../docs/) that is more about a handy or notes to
understand and learn better and to test my own understaning about learning and exploiting PDFs and
to be able implement exploit preventions in quality.
