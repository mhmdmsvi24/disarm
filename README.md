# Disarm

Disarm is a PDF security tool designed to identify various PDF exploits and cleanse malicious content. This project is part of my university research focused on understanding PDF vulnerabilities and developing practical defenses against them.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To get started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required tool:
   ```
   pip install pdfid
   ```
4. Check the [todo.md](./TODO.md) file and pick a task.
5. Create a new branch for your work.
6. Start coding!

If you discover anything new or suspicious:

1. Document your findings about suspicious PDFs and how to mitigate them in the project documentation.
2. Propose adding the task to the todo list if contributors agree.

## Research and Learning

This project serves as a research platform to deepen understanding of PDF documents and their security issues. All research materials and findings are organized in the [research](./research/) folder:

- [docs](./research/docs/) contains notes and assorted content.
- [learn](./research/learn/) is a daily documentation of my learning process.
- [sources.md](./research/sources.md) lists all learning materials, tools, and references used throughout the project.

## Acknowledgements

This project leverages tools developed by Didier Stevens, notably [pdfid](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/) and pdf-parser, which have been instrumental in analyzing PDF files. For more insights into PDF security, his website and research handbook are excellent resources.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to collaborate!
